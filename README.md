The industry of telecommunications is competitive. In this industry, customers are able to make 
their selections between different service providers. They may actively switch from one phone 
carrier to another because of price differences, service qualities and other factors. Typically, 
phone carriers experience an average annual customer churn rate of 15-25%. [1] In 2020, this 
number was 21%. [2] Since acquiring a new customer normally costs 5-10 times more than 
retaining an existing customer [1], it is extremely important for phone carriers to improve their 
client retention rate. 
One important issue involved in retaining the customers is to detect those customers who are 
likely to change service providers in the near future. The phone carriers could reach out to these 
customers and retain them by offering special discounts or improving services based on their 
feedback, if the phone carriers could predict that these customers would churn. 
The task of this project is to develop a machine learning model which helps phone carriers to 
predict their customer churns. The model will take each customerâ€™s temporal behavioral data as 
input and predict if the customer will churn in the future. We will develop a few models using 
different algorithms, use cross validations to measure their performance, and select one model 
that performs best.
